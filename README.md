## Rosette 123

I started by implementing `classify.rkt`, which I was able to sucessfully get working.

I then answered questions 2 and 5 from the homework (Tseitin's encoding and SAT solving using CaDiCaL), present in `hw1.md`. Time permitting, I would have also liked to solve the graph coloring problem.
